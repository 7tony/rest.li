  /**
   * updatePartitionState
   *
   * We have two mechanisms to influence the health and traffic patterns of the client. They are
   * by load balancing (switching traffic from one host to another) and by degrading service
   * (dropping calls). We load balance by allocating points in a consistent hash ring based on the
   * computedDropRate of the individual TrackerClients, which takes into account the latency
   * seen by that TrackerClient's requests. We can alternatively, if the cluster is
   * unhealthy (by using a high latency watermark) drop a portion of traffic across all tracker
   * clients corresponding to this cluster.
   *
   * The reason we do not currently consider error rate when adjusting the hash ring is that
   * there are legitimate errors that servers can send back for clients to handle, such as
   * 400 return codes. A potential improvement would be to catch transport level exceptions and 500
   * level return codes, but the implication of that would need to be carefully understood and documented.
   *
   * We don't want both to reduce hash points and allow clients to manage their own drop rates
   * because the clients do not have a global view that the load balancing strategy does. Without
   * a global view, the clients won't know if it already has a reduced number of hash points. If the
   * client continues to drop at the same drop rate as before their points have been reduced, then
   * the client would have its outbound request reduced by both reduction in points and the client's
   * drop rate. To avoid this, the drop rate is managed globally by the load balancing strategy and
   * provided to each client. The strategy will alternate between adjusting the hash ring points or
   * the global drop rate in order to avoid double penalizing a client.
   *
   * We also have a mechanism for recovery if the number of points in the hash ring is not
   * enough to receive traffic. The initialRecoveryLevel is a number between 0.0 and 1.0, and
   * corresponds to a weight of the tracker client's full hash points.
   * The reason for the weight is to allow an initialRecoveryLevel that corresponds to
   * less than one hash point. This would be useful if a "cooling off" period is desirable for the
   * misbehaving tracker clients, ie , given a full weight of 100 hash points,0.005 means that
   * there will be one cooling off period before the client is reintroduced into the hash ring.
   *
   * The second configuration, rampFactor, will geometrically increase the
   * previous recoveryLevel if traffic still hasn't been seen for that tracker client.
   *
   * For example, given initialRecoveryLevel = 0.01, rampFactor = 2, and default tracker client hash
   * points of 100, we will increase the hash points in this pattern on successive update States:
   *  0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, etc., aborting as soon as
   * calls are recorded for that tracker client.
   *
   * We also have highWaterMark and lowWaterMark as properties of the DegraderLoadBalancer strategy
   * so that the strategy can make decisions on whether to start dropping traffic globally across
   * all tracker clients for this cluster. The amount of traffic to drop is controlled by the
   * globalStepUp and globalStepDown properties, where globalStepUp controls how much the global
   * drop rate increases per interval, and globalStepDown controls how much the global drop rate
   * decreases per interval. We only step up the global drop rate when the average cluster latency
   * is higher than the highWaterMark, and only step down the global drop rate when the average
   * cluster latency is lower than the global drop rate.
   *
   * This code is thread reentrant. Multiple threads can potentially call this concurrently, and so
   * callers must pass in the DegraderLoadBalancerState that they based their shouldUpdate() call on.
   * The multiple threads may have different views of the trackerClients latency, but this is
   * ok as the new state in the end will have only taken one action (either loadbalance or
   * call-dropping with at most one step). Currently we will not call this concurrently, as
   * checkUpdatePartitionState will control entry to a single thread.
